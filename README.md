# How to Predict When There Are *Really* Few Positives? - Predictive Maintenance for Pumps
Here, you find an analysis of pump data sensor taken from [pump_sensor_data](https://www.kaggle.com/nphantawee/pump-sensor-data/) posted on Kaggle.
## The challenge: 
- 53 sensors for one pump sending their measurements by the minute for about 153 days (~220k minutes). 
- The aim is to predict when a pump is down, that is, when it is in need of maintenance.
- However, out of the 220k minutes it breaks only 7 minutes and is recovering 14477 or 10 days in total.
## Slide show
Obviously, there is a [notebook](https://github.com/dullibri/pump_sensor/blob/main/pump_sensors.ipynb) containing the steps and a [requirements.txt](https://github.com/dullibri/pump_sensor/blob/main/requirements.txt) to replicate the results. 
As a bonus, you also find an [html presentation](https://github.com/dullibri/pump_sensor/blob/main/pump_sensors.slides.html) produced with jupyter slides.
Make sure to download it to view it properly. Unnecessarily, the [data](https://github.com/dullibri/pump_sensor/blob/main/pump_sensors.rar) are also uploaded here.
